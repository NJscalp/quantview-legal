  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-12-16</p>

  <h3>1) Who we are</h3>
  <p>
    QuantView is a trading journal app with a live economic news feature. It is privately operated by
    Normann Jungbauer. This Privacy Policy explains how data is handled when you use the app.
  </p>

  <h3>2) What data the app processes</h3>

  <h4>2.1 Trade journal data (user content)</h4>
  <p>
    QuantView allows you to create and store trading journal entries (e.g., trades, notes, tags, performance metrics).
    This information is stored so the app can function as a journal. Please avoid entering sensitive personal data
    (e.g., health data, government IDs) into notes.
  </p>

  <h4>2.2 Cloud sync / cloud storage</h4>
  <p>
    Your trade journal data is synced with a cloud backend to enable backup and multi-device access.
    This means your journal data is transmitted to and stored in cloud infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Cloud provider:</strong> <!-- Replace with your actual provider, e.g., "Apple iCloud (CloudKit)", "AWS", "Firebase", "Supabase", etc. -->
    Not specified.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use cloud storage only to provide core app functionality (saving and syncing your journal data).
    We do not sell your journal data and do not use it for advertising.
  </p>

  <h4>2.3 Subscriptions (Monthly / Yearly)</h4>
  <p>
    QuantView offers auto-renewable subscriptions (monthly and yearly). Purchases and billing are processed by Apple
    via the App Store. We do not receive or store your payment details (such as credit card numbers).
  </p>
  <p>
    The app may check your subscription status (via Apple’s in-app purchase system) to enable premium features.
  </p>

  <h4>2.4 Live economic news</h4>
  <p>
    QuantView displays live economic news content fetched from external sources. When the app requests news,
    your device necessarily connects to those services (which may receive standard technical data such as IP address
    and device/network metadata). We do not intentionally send identifying user information to news providers.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>News source(s):</strong> <!-- Replace with your actual provider(s) -->
    Not specified.
  </p>

  <h4>2.5 In-app calendar</h4>
  <p>
    QuantView includes an in-app calendar feature. It is internal to the app and does not access your device calendar,
    contacts, or location.
  </p>

  <h4>2.6 Contacting us</h4>
  <p>
    If you contact us by email, we will process the information you provide (e.g., email address and message content)
    solely to respond and provide support.
  </p>

  <h3>3) What we do NOT do</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>No advertising tracking</li>
    <li>No third-party analytics SDKs (as stated by the operator)</li>
    <li>No cookies (the app does not use cookies like a website would)</li>
    <li>No collection of location data</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4) Legal basis (EEA/UK – GDPR)</h3>
  <p>
    Where GDPR applies, we process data based on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong> (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR): providing the app’s core journaling and sync features</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR): maintaining app functionality and security</li>
    <li><strong>Consent</strong> (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR): where required (e.g., if you voluntarily email us certain information)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5) Sharing of data</h3>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal data. Data may be processed by service providers strictly as needed to operate the app,
    such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Apple</strong> (App Store billing / subscription processing)</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud infrastructure provider</strong> used for syncing your journal data (see section 2.2)</li>
    <li><strong>News content providers</strong> used to fetch and display economic news (see section 2.4)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6) Data retention</h3>
  <p>
    Trade journal data is retained while you keep it in the app and/or while cloud sync is enabled.
    If the app provides deletion features, you can delete entries within the app. Depending on the cloud provider,
    deletion may take some time to propagate or remove backups.
  </p>
  <p>
    Support emails are retained only as long as necessary to handle your request and for reasonable record-keeping.
  </p>

  <h3>7) Security</h3>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect data in transit and at rest (depending on the cloud provider’s capabilities).
    However, no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure.
  </p>

  <h3>8) Your rights</h3>
  <p>
    Depending on your location, you may have rights such as access, correction, deletion, and objection to processing.
    To request help regarding your data, contact us at
    <a href="mailto:quantviewapp@gmail.com">quantviewapp@gmail.com</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>9) Children</h3>
  <p>
    QuantView is not intended for children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
  </p>

  <h3>10) Changes to this policy</h3>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will reflect the latest version.
